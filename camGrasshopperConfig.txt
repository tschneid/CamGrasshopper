# framerate = 3.75 | 7.5 | 15* | 30 | 60 | 120 | 240
# Other factors like a long integration time (high shutter)
# or the bus bandwidth limitation might decrease
# the actual received framerate.

# trigger = 0* | 1 | 2 | 3
# The trigger specifies how to trigger the
# image integration of the cameras.
# 0 = no trigger
# 1 = software trigger
# 2 = firewire trigger (only on the same bus)
# 3 = hardware trigger (pulse on GPIO pin)

# masterCam = 0* | 1 | ...
# The master camera will define the shutter speed, gain, etc.,
# and distribute the properties to the other cameras.
# If no master camera is specified, each camera will determine
# the properties independently.

# shutter = x
# determines the shutter speed (integration time) in milliseconds.
# Lower shutter speed will result in higher gain and therefore noise.
# If no shutter speed is specified, the camera will determine the
# shutter speed (this might be slow)

# triggerThread = ON* | OFF
# Use a dedicated thread to trigger the cameras, might improve the
# framerate in certain situations
